# Behaviorial Cloning Project


Overview
---
The goals of this project were:

    Use a driving simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
    Build a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
    Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
    Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road


My project includes the following files:

    model.py containing the script to create and train the model
    drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
    model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network
    image_process_demo.py for outputting samples of processed images
    writeup_report.md and writeup_report.ipynb summarizing the results

### Dependencies
This project requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:

* model.py
* generator.py
* image_process_demo.py
* drive.py
* video.py
* writeup_template.md

The simulator can be downloaded from Udacity.

## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.

### `model.py`

Contains the pipeline for NVIDIA CNN Architecture using Keras

### `generator.py`

Contains a generator function for batchwise data processing in order to avoid memory shortage error.

### `image_process_demo.py`

Contains code for visualizing the results of image pre-processing techniques used in this project.

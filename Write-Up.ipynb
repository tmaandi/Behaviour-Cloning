    "#### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "My model consists of a convolutional neural network similar to NVIDIA's CNN used for training and driving a car autonomously. This network uses 5 x 5 and 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 24 and 64 (refer model.py). The network implementation is done using Keras library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes RELU activations in the convolutional layers to introduce nonlinearity, and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer. Another keras lambda layer is used to crop the image data. The benefit of using cropping layer as a part of the network is so that it can use the GPU capability to crop multiple images simultaneously thus saving considerable time in training.\n",
    "The model also contains a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 40% in order to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (used test_train_split function for splitting training data). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. The data provided for 1 lap completion was used as the primary data source. I used a combination of centre, left and right camera data. Using left and right camera data helped in cornering through sharp turns. The steering angle value was corrected accordingly for left and right camera training data. I observed that using too high steering correction factor would make car zig-zag all over the place and using too low steering correction would hurt the training and the car would perform even worse than center lane only training. In addition, I also flipped the centre camera data and used it for training. This helped the network generalize better and I didn't have to use the clockwise lap traverse data as np.flipr\" had a \n",
